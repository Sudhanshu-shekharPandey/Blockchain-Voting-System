Voting is a fundamental democratic activity. Many experts believe that paper balloting is the only appropriate method to ensure everyoneâ€™s right to vote. But this method is prone to errors and abuse. Many nations utilize digital voting methods to solve the difficulties of paper balloting. A single flaw in digital voting may lead to massive vote-rigging. Election voting methods must be legal, accurate, safe, and convenient. However, issues with digital voting methods may restrict acceptance. Due to its end-to-end verification capabilities, blockchain technology was developed to address these problems. To guarantee We have used blockchain technology for anonymity, privacy, verifiability, mobility, integrity, security, and fairness in voting.
